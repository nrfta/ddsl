Database DevOps - Database-as-Code
----------------------------------

DDSL (pronouced "diesel") is a database devops tool that allows you to work with your DDL (Data Definition Language)
code just like any other code in your project. DDL can be tracked in your version control system and deployed onto
your RDS (Relational Database System) platform using simple commands. Seed data can be applied for testing scenarios
and for production. See :ref: `database-as-code` for more on the need and philosophy behind DDSL.
